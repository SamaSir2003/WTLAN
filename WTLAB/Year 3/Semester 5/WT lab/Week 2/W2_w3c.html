    <p>
      The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community that
      develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web. It was
      founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee. The consortium is made up of member
      organizations, a full-time staff, and the public who work together to
      develop open web standards.

    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>
      The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee
      after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in
      October 1994. It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
      (MIT) Laboratory for Computer Science with support from the European
      Commission, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which had
      pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the Internet. Since
      January 2023, W3C has become its own legal entity, moving to a
      public-interest non-profit organization after 28 years with an atypical
      organizational structure where legal and fiduciary roles were assumed by
      four host institutions across the planet: MIT (USA), ERCIM (France), Keio
      University (Japan), and Beihang University (China).

    <p>
      W3C's global standards constitute the toolkit for web solutions that
      scale, enabling innovators to solve hard problems, providing the proper
      foundations to meet requirements for accessibility, internationalization,
      privacy, and security on the web. More than 400 Members from around the
      world lead the development and implementation of standards. Over 12,000
      developers worldwide participate in the standards development. W3C
      standards improve web security through the development of authentication
      technologies that can replace weak passwords and reduce phishing and other
      sophisticated cyberattacks.
